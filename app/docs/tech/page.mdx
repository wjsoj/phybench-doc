# Tech Report

## Getting Started

The Source Code of this project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/wjsoj/phybench-website). You can clone the project and run it locally.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Caution: To run the project locally, you need to have the `.env` or `.env.local` file in the root directory. The content of the file should be like this:

```env
# Database URL For Prisma ORM 
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ip:port/name"

# OAuth2 Client ID and Secret (With PKU UAAA)
AUTH_CLIENT_ID=""
AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=""
AUTH_CLIENT_ISSUER="https://unifiedauth.pku.edu.cn"

# Auth.js Secret
AUTH_SECRET=""

# For Calling AI endpoint
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-<your-key>"
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL="<your-api-endpoint>"
```

For reason of security, the `.env` file is not included in the repository. You need to create it by yourself. For sensitive information, please contact the project owner.

You may need to set up a local development database. Currently, the project uses PostgreSQL deployed by docker-compose. You can create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    container_name: phy-postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
      - POSTGRES_DB=${DB_NAME}
    ports:
      - 5435:5432
    volumes:
      - /extra/db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: always
    networks:
      - phy-network
  minio:
    image: minio/minio
    container_name: phy-minio
    mem_limit: 1G
    volumes:
      - /extra/minio_data:/etc/minio/data
    environment:
      - MINIO_ROOT_USER=${MINIO_ROOT_USER}
      - MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=${MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD}
    restart: always
    ports:
      - ${MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT}:9001
      - ${MINIO_API_PORT}:${MINIO_API_PORT}
    command: >
      server /etc/minio/data --address ":${MINIO_API_PORT}" --console-address
      ":9001"
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      - phy-network
networks:
  phy-network:
    driver: bridge
```

The `minio` image is used for storing files (Currently not being used). The volume path and ports can be changed according to your needs. You should also create a `.env` file in the same directory of `docker-compose.yml` with the necessary environment variables. 

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Authentication:** Auth.js with [PKU UAAA](https://unifiedauth.pku.edu.cn)
- **UI Components Library:** shadcn/UI
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS
- **Markdown Render:** react-markdown
- **Code Highlight:** react-syntax-highlighter
- **Math Render:** KaTeX by remark-math
- **Icon Library:** lucide
- **Static MDX Render:** @mdx-js/react
- **Motion Animation:** framer-motion
- **Type Checking:** Zod
- **Linter:** ESLint

We currently use a series of experimental technologies in this project. Including:

- **Packaging:** Turbopack for Next.js
- **New version of Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS v4 (Released on January 22, 2025)
- **OpenAI Node SDK:** We are using the alpha version, which is not released yet.

These technologies are still under development and not stable yet. We will keep updating the project to the latest version of these libraries.

## Deployment

We currently use pm2 to deploy the project. You can use the following command to deploy the project on the server:

```bash
npm run build
npm run pm2start
```

In the future, we may use Docker to deploy the project, which is still under development.
